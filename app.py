    """
    Generates a tailored cold email AND provides resume modification advice
    in a single API call, returning a structured JSON object.
    """
    prompt = f"""
    You are an expert career assistant. Your task is to generate two things based on the provided job description and resume:
    1. A professional, skimmable cold email, tailored primarily to the job description.
    2. Actionable advice on how to subtly modify the resume to better align with the job posting.

    **Inputs:**
    - Job Posting: {job_data}
    - My Current Resume: {resume_data}

    **Task 1: Generate the Cold Email**
    - Write a short, professional email expressing interest in the job.
    - **Prioritize tailoring the content to the job description.** Use the resume as a factual basis for experience, but frame it to match the job's needs.
    - Follow the provided email format. Use bullet points for clarity.
    - Use Markdown's double asterisks (`**text**`) to bold key elements for emphasis: **Job Title**, **Company Name**, specific **technical skills**, and **quantifiable metrics**.

    **Email Format to Follow:**
    Hi [Recruiter Name if available],
    I hope you're doing well. I‚Äôm reaching out to express my strong interest in the **[Job Title]** opportunity at **[Company Name]**. I‚Äôm enthusiastic about the possibility of contributing to your team.
    Here‚Äôs a quick overview of how my experience aligns with your needs:
    - [Relevant Experience/Project 1: Frame it to match a responsibility/requirement from the job posting. Include relevant tech.]
    - [Relevant Experience/Project 2: Frame it to match another key requirement. Include relevant tech and quantifiable outcomes if possible.]
    - [Summary of technical proficiency, highlighting skills mentioned in the job description.]
    I am confident that my background in [mention 1-2 key areas from the job description, e.g., 'full-stack development and cloud infrastructure'] makes me a strong candidate.
    I‚Äôve attached my resume for your review and would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills can benefit your team.
    Thank you for your time!
    Sincerely,
    [Your Name]

    **Task 2: Generate Resume Modification Advice**
    - Provide a list of specific, actionable suggestions for modifying the resume to better match the job.
    - **Crucial Constraint:** Do NOT invent new projects or work experiences. All suggestions must be based on the existing resume content.
    - Focus on:
        - Rephrasing bullet points to include keywords from the job description.
        - Highlighting or re-ordering skills in the 'Skills' or 'Tech Stack' section to match the job's priorities.
        - Suggesting which projects to emphasize.
    - The advice should be encouraging and easy to follow.

    **Final Output Format:**
    Return a single, valid JSON object with two keys: "email_content" and "resume_advice".
    {{
        "email_content": "The full Markdown text of the generated email goes here.",
        "resume_advice": "The full Markdown text for the resume advice goes here, using bullet points for suggestions."
